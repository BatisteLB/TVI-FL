# TVI-FL

This, under construction, repository will contain code that implements the Time-Varying Ising model with Fused and Lasso penalties (TVI-FL) algorithm presented in the paper:

\textit{Learning the piece-wise constant graph structure of a varying Ising model}. Batiste Le Bars, Pierre Humbert, Argyris Kalogeratos and Nicolas Vayatis. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2020.

It will be made available by the camera-ready submission (august 14th 2020). Until then, refer to the supplementary file associated to the paper.
