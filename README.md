# TVI-FL

This, under construction, repository will contain code that implements the Time-Varying Ising model with Fused and Lasso penalties (TVI-FL) algorithm presented in the paper:

Learning the piece-wise constant graph structure of a varying Ising model. Batiste Le Bars, Pierre Humbert, Argyris Kalogeratos and Nicolas Vayatis. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2020.

It will be made available by the camera-ready submission (august 14th 2020). Until then, refer to the supplementary file associated to the paper.
