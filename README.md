# TVI-FL

This repository contains code that implements the Time-Varying Ising model with Fused and Lasso penalties (TVI-FL) algorithm presented in the paper:

Learning the piece-wise constant graph structure of a varying Ising model. Batiste Le Bars, Pierre Humbert, Argyris Kalogeratos and Nicolas Vayatis. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2020.

II. Code Information

- Use the TVI_FL function from TVI_FL.py to apply the proposed algorithm from the paper "Learning the piece-wise constant graph structure of a varying Ising model".

- To perform the real-world experiment on the votes in the llinois House of Representatives, run the Jupyter Notebook "ICML_Experiment.ipynb". The data are already preprocessed.
  
- If code cell 4 is too long to run, then you can directly run cell 5 to obtain the results.
